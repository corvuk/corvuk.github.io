        As the first wave of the COVID-19 virus began to take hold globally, we could only watch as
        entire countries began to implement reactionary measures with ease. It was disturbing to see
        just how easily martial law could be enacted in the states it was enacted in. I wanted
        to explore deep-seated, cosmic horror - a terror that cannot be seen nor explained,
        as the era of household quarantine unfolded.

        This unfinished game started with the idea of the mythological black dog. Known to be
        either malevolent or benevolent, I wanted to explore the narrative of a guardian spirit
        that acts as a psychopomp, or ferry of the dead.<br>The internet and the digital
        realm are just as real as the physical one we walk in, so I thought it would be fun
        to write about a psychopomp who has undertaken a job transferral to service digital
        space: protecting, guiding, subtly manipulating, and of course, ferrying souls onto
        the next world.<br>
