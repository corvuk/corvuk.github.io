	  <p>"Solidarity forever" using an Arduino piezo buzzer.<br>
      Very rough, but for a quick foray, I'm happy how this turned out. Some of the
      melody is even recognisable!<br>
      This song is lifted from an established melody ("Battle hymn of the Republic")
      as is a lot of working class tunes of solidarity, but I specifically am referencing
      "Solidarity forever," written by Ralph Chaplin in 1915.<br>
      Who's the author here? Who's the artist?
